# Imhotep Academy

## Program Overview

Founded in 1992 and currently funded by the Biogen Foundation, Imhotep Academy is a year-round middle school enrichment program that introduces students to the world of STEM with a particular emphasis on reaching underserved and students historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines. Imhotep aims to increase students’ awareness and enthusiasm for learning STEM, build students’ confidence and identity in STEM, and inspire students to continue studying STEM throughout high school and college. Participants engage in a variety of activities including hands-on investigations, laboratory tours, field trips, leadership, college readiness, and interactions with STEM professionals.

## Imhotep Academy Summer Arduino and Computer Science Session

Middle school students (6th - 8th) will explore the world of electronics, computing and design through team-based investigations. Students will use low and high tech materials to design e-wearable prototypes. Prototypes will be tested and used to collect data from a variety of biotic systems. All activities will take place at The Science House on NCSU’s campus.
